# hello-world
I am learning about GitHub :)

In church, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In family, I am the oldest brother of a large family. We love to spend time together and travel.

In programming and computer science, I love learning. I have taken an online course in Python, and parts of JavaScript, Swift, and Java. I also love to make videos.
